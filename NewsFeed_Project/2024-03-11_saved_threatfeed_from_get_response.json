the North Korean APT group Kimsuky. Troll Stealer is an information-stealing malware written in Go language that exfiltrates data including SSH credentials, FileZilla information, browser data, system info, and screen captures. It is distributed via droppers disguised as Korean security software installers, signed with a stolen certificate from D2innovation Co. LTD. Troll Stealer appears related to previous Kimsuky malware AppleSeed and AlphaSeed based on code similarities, and specifically targets the GPKI certificate folder on systems, suggesting it is aimed at

backdoor used in long-term cyber espionage operation targeting an Islamic organization","description":"Cisco Talos discovered an ongoing espionage campaign targeting an Islamic charitable organization in Saudi Arabia using a new backdoor malware family named Zardoor. The threat actor has likely been active since at least March 2021 and uses customized reverse proxy tools like Fast Reverse Proxy, sSocks, and Venom to establish command and control. The attacker spreads tools like Zardoor through Windows Management Instrumentation and maintains persistence with scheduled tasks. Talos assesses this is an advanced threat actor based on their ability to create new malware, customize open source tools, and use living-off-the-land techniques to remain undetected.","author_name":"AlienVault","modified":"2024-03-09T15:01:45.705000","created":"2024-02-08T15:39:51.068000","revision":4,"tlp":"white","public":1,"adversary":"","indicators":[{"id":2811717897,"indicator":"7905bd9bb4d277a81935a22f975a0030faa9e5c9dbb9f6152c2f56ba1cd0cdea","type":"FileHash-SHA256","created":"2024-02-08T15:39:51","content":"","title":"","description":"","expiration":null,"is_active":1,"role":null},{"id":3437179717,"indicator":"e0f4afe374d75608d604fbf108eac64f","type":"FileHash-MD5","created":"2024-02-08T15:39:51","content":"","title":"","description":"","expiration":null,"is_active":1,"role":null},{"id":3590682769,"indicator":"60d5648d35bacf5c7aa713b2a0d267d3","type":"FileHash-MD5","created":"2024-02-08T15:39:51","content":"","title":"","description":"","expiration":null,"is_active":1,"role":null},{"id":3590682776,"indicator":"a62af4ac233d914a25e79ec0705e2a187ebd7567","type":"FileHash-SHA1","created":"2024-02-08T15:39:51","content":"","title":"","description":"","expiration":null,"is_active":1,"role":null},{"id":3590682779,"indicator":"4b16ea1b1273f8746cf399c71bfc1f5bff7378b5414b4ea044c55e0ee08c89d3","type":"FileHash-SHA256","created":"2024-02-08T15:39:51","content":"","title":"","description":"","expiration":null,"is_active":1,"role":null},{"id":3623885149,"indicator":"3e79a2e6747adcd898f146b29dd5d30b6bb08222","type":"FileHash-SHA1","created":"2024-02-08T15:39:51","content":"","title":"","description":"","expiration":null,"is_active":1,"role":null},{"id":3680652415,"indicator":"dd5694d0797e22f521faeb6026eddaa8","type":"FileHash-MD5","created":"2024-02-08T15:39:51","content":"","title":"","description":"","expiration":null,"is_active":1,"role":null},{"id":3680652417,"indicator":"179a161d33a2b9d37a0cffe6d51c673c554a0f68","type":"FileHash-SHA1","created":"2024-02-08T15:39:51","content":"","title":"","description":"","expiration":null,"is_active":1,"role":null},{"id":3680652443,"indicator":"5655a2981fa4821fe09c997c84839c16d582d65243c782f45e14c96a977c594e","type":"FileHash-SHA256","created":"2024-02-08T15:39:51","content":"","title":"","description":"","expiration":null,"is_active":1,"role":null},{"id":3748062485,"indicator":"ec956ae1cd30bad3ebd55a984ce3d9ed","type":"FileHash-MD5","created":"2024-02-08T15:39:51","content":"","title":"","description":"","expiration":null,"is_active":1,"role":null},{"id":3748062502,"indicator":"56d8066f332625a595a25a3b5f90e6c6abdf402f","type":"FileHash-SHA1","created":"2024-02-08T15:39:51","content":"","title":"","description":"","expiration":null,"is_active":1,"role":null},{"id":3748062517,"indicator":"0058d495254bf3760b30b5950d646f9a38506cef8f297c49c3b73c208ab723bf","type":"FileHash-SHA256","created":"2024-02-08T15:39:51","content":"","title":"","description":"","expiration":null,"is_active":1,"role":null},{"id":3748062522,"indicator":"0a5aa03e35d6d9218342b2bec753a9800570c000964801cf6bfe45a9bb393c0d","type":"FileHash-SHA256","created":"2024-02-08T15:39:51","content":"","title":"","description":"","expiration":null,"is_active":1,"role":null},{"id":3748062528,"indicator":"1480b2038395f9edd2c21dff68eb29a4d6177708b70b687f758af60c8b02f071","type":"FileHash-SHA256","created":"2024-02-08T15:39:51","content":"","title":"","description":"","expiration":null,"is_active":1,"role":null},{"id":3748062529,"indicator":"1aea1e7098221f2cc76ccd45078d9a216236b4e7e295dfa68e8a25aab3abe778","type":"FileHash-SHA256","created":"2024-02-08T15:39:51","content":"","title":"","description":"","expiration":null,"is_active":1,"role":null},{"id":3748062536,"indicator":"29741f7987ab61b85adb310a7ab2f44405822f1719fa431c8f49007b64f6f5cd","type":"FileHash-SHA256","created":"2024-02-08T15:39:51","content":"","title":"","description":"","expiration":null,"is_active":1,"role":null},{"id":3748062548,"indicator":"3adcc81446f0e8ed1a2bc1e815613eb5622afba57941d651faa2b5bc4b2f13c1","type":"FileHash-SHA256","created":"2024-02-08T15:39:51","content":"","title":"","description":"","expiration":null,"is_active":1,"role":null},{"id":3748062561,"indicator":"5226b67b5d49720981841fab64794533fe0530409ba2975e6125a4bc008f2480","type":"FileHash-SHA256","created":"2024-02-08T15:39:51","content":"","title":"","description":"","expiration":null,"is_active":1,"role":null},{"id":3748062573,"indicator":"5eeab7b795a3303c368c72ef09a345f3a4f02301ec443e98319d600e8287e852","type":"FileHash-SHA256","created":"2024-02-08T15:39:51","content":"","title":"","description":"","expiration":null,"is_active":1,"role":null},{"id":3748062576,"indicator":"73c7459e0c3ba00c0566f7baa710dd8b88ef3cf75ee0e76d36c5d8cd73083095","type":"FileHash-SHA256","created":"2024-02-08T15:39:51","content":"","title":"","description":"","expiration":null,"is_active":1,"role":null},{"id":3748062579,"indicator":"7abf74260ae5b771182e95bc360fefa1b635b56b3aa05922506d55c5d15517c3","type":"FileHash-SHA256","created":"2024-02-08T15:39:51","content":"","title":"","description":"","expiration":null,"is_active":1,"role":null},{"id":3748062659,"indicator":"a99a9f285
